            This is the index page (named index.html). This is your home page, which will be the first page that loads when someone visits yourwebsite.com.

            HTML (HyperText markup language), in its most basic form,
            is a language to format and display content on the web.
            HTML uses "tags" to define containers for your content.
            For example, this block of text is inside a "paragraph" container, 
            which begins with &ltp&gt and ends with &lt/p&gt.
            <br><br>
            HTML has come a long way since it was first released (HTML 1.0 - 1993).
            These days, we typically use HTML to define our content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to
            define how that content is displayed.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
            This text has been styled directly in the HTML,
            by creating an additional paragraph block and defining its style property.
        </p>
